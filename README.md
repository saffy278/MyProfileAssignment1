<h2> Personal Information </h2>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/lEMv3pT.jpg"/>
<p>My name is Jai Farmer and my number is S3762742</p>
<p>My RMIT email address is s3762742@student.rmit.edu.au</p> 
My personal email is jaifarmer99@gmail.com
<p> I live in the Mount Eliza green belt in Southeast Victoria.</p>
<p> I left school after finishing year 10 and then completed my Diploma in Information Technology. The Diploma gave me a great introduction to project management, coding in Javascript, HTML and website design. This gave me the enthusiasm to apply to RMIT and pursue a Bachelor in IT. </p>
<p> My personal interests include computer games, basketball, fantasy and sci-fi movies, spending time with my friends especially my girlfriend.</p>
<p>I have a special condition called heterochromia, which means one of my eyes has a different colour in it, I also have 20/20 hindsight.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p> I have a wide interest in many IT areas such as game development, robotics, Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, SpaceX, hacking(Ethical) and drones. I have a special interest in playing computer games such as World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, Counter-Strike, Dota2 and Sid Meier's Civilization V.</p>
<p>The first time I was interested in IT, was when my dad bought a family computer and bought a copy of WoW which was a huge game back in the day. I remember having to install it with at least 5 disks(and it took a whole day to download the game). World of Warcraft was my favourite game as my cousins also played with me and completed the content together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I chose RMIT because the IT course had a great reputation and a good campus. I also heard from my friends that RMIT is one of the best universities in Melbourne for IT.</p>
<p>I expect to learn a more in-depth view of the IT world and I hope that the opportunities that it can give me lead to a bountiful career. I hope to become an expert in Java and other programming languages such as Python, C++ and C#. I also aspire to become a skilled cybersecurity person.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p></p>

<p>The job entails specialising in penetration testing and creating highly detailed reports on vulnerabilities a business might have and to create solutions for the cybersecurity problems. This job appeals to me because it includes the things I want to learn such as Java, Python and using penetration systems to test the security of websites and applications, It also has a very high salary.
The Skills I would need for this job is a high level of JavaScript, Objective C and Python, this role needs a high level of problem-solving skill, as you will be trying to penetrate systems as well as creating and improving them. The Qualifications I would need for this job would be to have at least an industry certification in one of the following: SANS, CREST CRT/CCT or OSCE and to know the vulnerabilities regarding OWASP and SANS.  I would need experience in performing internal and external penetration testing, web application testing and mobile penetration testing.

 <p>The skills I currently have is beginner knowledge in Python and JavaScript as well as having good knowledge of how computers work, and can use understand and use most software. I currently know nothing about cyber security and I am very interested in trying to learn it and understand how it all works. I currently have no experience in the IT field for a work point of view however, I have been using computers all my life and continue to use them on a daily basis.</p>
 
<p>I will need to improve my skills in JavaScript and Python greatly and start to understand how cybersecurity works but using one of my IT electives next year to study it in greater detail. I will then try to do an industry cybersecurity course(SANS) in order to learn the advanced methods of penetration testing and how it works in the job industry. I am also interested in doing a course in Ethical Hacking as I believe it would help greatly in the cyber security field.

<h2> Person Profile </h2>
 <p>The result of my Myers-Briggs test was ENFJ-A(Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judgement). I believe this is reasonably accurate as I am certainly more extraverted than introverted and enjoy spending time with my friends in person and keeping up with what is happening in their lives. Being more extroverted can be a bit of a distraction though when you need to settle down and get work done as you are wondering what else you could be doing with your friends. I do think I rely on intuition and my gut feeling to make decisions as I want to make sure something feels right before I decide to investigate further. So the test was interesting and worthwhile for anyone to get some ideas about how their mind works. </p>

<p>The result for the online learning style test is, Jai's scores:</p>
<p>Auditory: 30%</p>
<p>Visual: 35%</p>
<p>Tactile: 35%</p>

<p> I chose to do a creativity course for my third test from testmycreativity.com and managed to get a creativity score of 60.65.</p>

<p>The results of these tests give me a good idea of how I should work within a team as it shows how I do well in some areas and also tells me where I have weaknesses. 
The results tell me that I am more of a leader than a follower as I like to take initiative and take order in what Iâ€™m doing. I also learn better visually rather than through auditory which helps me better understand how I learn.
When forming a team I should now consider these newly identified traits, as I believe it would help me develop my skills and to become a better person. </p>

<h2> Project Idea </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Project I am creating is called <b>"CyberBuddy"</b> and will support a person while they are online to reduce their risks of being hacked by malicious individuals and organisations. People are not very aware of how their clicking on weblinks can take them to dangerous places that look similar to legitimate websites, however, they may be going to a front for cybercriminals. The software will then grow in subsequent stages to allow evaluation and repair of Cyber Security leaks and threats in software as well. This application runs on any device however, my focus market will be Smart Phone platforms, e.g Android and iOS. The goal for this project is to create a functional cyber security application that tests the levels of security for various activities, applications and/or websites the user is engaged with. The application is aimed at keeping our personal data safe from being misused. I believe many people would want to use the Application to get a sort of score out of 10 on how good their personal security is for their common internet activities and of course protecting themselves online.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The motivation comes from my personal interest in the cybersecurity aspect of IT as my Dad's company was hacked by a competitor and it cost him dearly as the attack was quite sophisticated over several months and all new business leads were diverted leading to a downturn in his business and he was forced to close down after 15 years and employing over one hundred people. Cyber Security is getting more sophisticated and there seems to be very little the Government and Police Force can actually do to track down cybercrime and protect people. It therefore, falls on others to build the software required to keep ahead of the cybercrime curve. The CyberBuddy software is an online assistant that reminds us to maintain good online behaviours that keep us safe.</p>

<p>I believe we all need to be more aware of the risks in using the Internet and so an application that evaluates your risks and gives a score on those risks would be very helpful and there will be a market for the product as long as it works seamlessly. The product must be easy for any user to implement and let them then plug any security vulnerabilities without hassle or at least they may need to change their behaviours to keep themselves safe with Cyber Buddy's guidance. The key is having remedies to counter the threats detected and make people's online browsing much more secure. </p>

<p>For around five years I have had a strong personal interest in ethical hacking and writing scripts that can help make my life easier online. The more I have invested in learning to master this area the more I realised that the Cyber Security arena is just massive and I have just scraped the tip of the iceberg. It is sort of exciting to know that you could never learn everything as every time someone builds a piece of software that there are people finding vulnerabilities to exploit. So the task of protecting systems will never go away. I think a career in cybersecurity will not disappear any time soon that is for sure.</p>



<h3>Description</h3>

<p>I believe that cybersecurity is a kind of mysterious area of the computer world and people donâ€™t really know how it works. Therefore, the features of my CyberBuddy Software will need to be very straight forward and I will build several stages as I release new features over time. The first stage is to support safe online behaviour with prompts and checks as users click on links and travel around their online world. This support stage, once successful, will then migrate to a more sophisticated Cyber Security Detection Application that includes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Simple to use interface with simple touch & click menu for mobile devices</li>
 <li>Be able to stress test your own websites and/or software used to see if and how it can be hacked,</li>
 <li>Write a Report identifying those vulnerabilities in plain English,</li>
 <li>Highlighting any software or methods being used that are potentially dangerous,</li>
 <li>Provide a Security Threat Score - say - out of 10 points so simple to understand,</li>
 <li>Provide advice on what could be done to improve the security score</li>
 </ul>
 

<p>
The first focus of this application will be aimed at how to reduce basic threats and risks that you may face in your everyday Internet Surfing life. We will be able to highlight security risks such as where you may be entering passwords and jumping to unsafe URLs to ensure the websites are actually legitimate and you are not being tricked. People too easily just click on email and weblinks and do not carefully watch where they may be taken. My software could start out by at least watching over this and letting people know if they are going to an odd looking website that may be risky. E.g. CyberBuddy will warn you about problems like clicking on a simple YouTube link that takes you somewhere potentially dangerous and flag this straight away before you get yourself into trouble.</p>

<p>The features of this app can be endless however, its main focus will be based around security online and keeping its users safe. This application will try to appeal to people in the market with minimal computer security expertise which is most people online. I thought about creating a Website for marketing purposes with an introductory video and short one minute Security Test that a person can take to assess their computer safety. For each score, the CyberBuddy Website will explain how you are vulnerable and how the CyberBuddy Software can support you improve your safety online. CyberBuddy could also provide training and other support to hopefully build a community. People need to invest more time into keeping themselves safe however, most people "don't know what they don't know", so step one is to get this message across to build credibility for the product.</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>Some of the skills I will need to build for this project involve programming in a variety of common languages used on the Internet and in common software like Javascript, Java, C++ & HTML. The skills in cybersecurity will take a long time to obtain and I probably need to do further certification after my Bachelor course in specific cybersecurity areas. I would also like to work in a cybersecurity development firm for several years to gain experience and build some networks.</p>


<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>The hardware I will need includes several mobile devices for real-world testing as well as a reasonably powerful PC and MAC. The software is readily available for free or for a small charge and will depend on what the final product is written in. E.g. I can use Eclipse for Java or Visual Studio for C++ development. It is likely that the software will need to be able to interrupt the user at the time they do something dangerous and I am not aware yet of what this software is however, I am sure it exists as I have seen similar software step in over the top of existing applications. </p>


<h3>Outcome </h3>
<p>The original problem I encountered was needing to download software online and not being able to determine if the website is legitimate or not and whether I am just loading malicious software onto my computer. The impact that this Application will have is to provide a solution for people to better protect themselves and support safer online behaviours. Extensions to the software will also allow easy safety and security testing of what the user is doing online on mainly mobile devices that can be used on the fly. CyberBuddy will help reduce vulnerabilities and encourage better cyber behaviours. Put simply, I wish to stop cybercrime and hackers early enough to be helpful for the many people who lack the technical skills to keep themselves safe.</p>
